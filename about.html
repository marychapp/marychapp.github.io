          <h3>About</h3>
            <p>I'm a recent graduate of Bowling Green State University (Ohio, not Kentucky) with a bachelor's degree. I drew a lot as a kid, so art is kind of a big part of my life. I got my first Wacom graphics tablet when I was fourteen and learned to use Photoshop to draw. I took several college courses as part of a learning program in high school which introduced me to the rest of the Adobe Suite. Graphic design was always part of my world, though I didn't know it at the time. I have nearly fifteen years experience using the Adobe Suite. I've recently started to learn Corel Painter and Clip Studio Paint (previously Manga Studio) in order to make my own graphic novel which is currently in progress. Illustrations are a key component to my design work. I use a variety of digital and traditional mediums to create my work including watercolors and Copic markers. My personal style is derived from the macabre, but I pride myself in being flexible in style to suit my client's needs. Most recently though, I've begun studying hand lettering techniques, a skill I want to specialize in. Currently, I'm studying HTML5 and CSS3 using Treehouse to build my own portfolio site (this version you're viewing was created by my partner). My interests are as diverse as the music I listen to: I love reading and writing (originallY, I was going to be a writer) and it's not out of the ordinary for you to see me drawing in a Moleskine. I love fountain pens, video games, cats, reading, movies, cartoons (yep, I even considered being an animator), and Japanese cuisine. Cats. I really like cats.</p>
