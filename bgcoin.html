          <h3>Dedication Coin</h3>
          <p>One of my favorite pieces from my days at Unigraphics. Bowling Green State University was building two new student housing units on campus: Centennial Hall and Falcon Heights. To commemorate the incoming freshmenâ€™s arrival, the university wanted to bestow upon them a coin with buildings of both halls on either side. I was personally put in charge of this project due to my excellent drawing skills and my ability to vector detailed work in Illustrator. Photos were supplied to me and I provded sketches of the layouts before the final one was chosen and vectored. The best part: I got to keep a coin once it was minted!</p>
