          <h3>Jazz For Jude</h3>
          <h5>Charity Dinner Brochure</h5>
          <p>Although this project was entirely for the sake of practicing brochure layouts, I feel that it was a valuable learning experience. I first went to work on picking a subject matter: charity work, which is something that is very important to me. I looked for a while and finally settled on St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital. I then set to work on finding an event that could host the charity dinner and entertainment. I’m from Detroit so the annual Jazz Festival they put on every year seemed like a perfect candidate. I chose red and silver because St. Jude’s colors are a deep red and silver would go nicely with it, giving it a classy feel. Futura and a custom font were chosen based on the era the typeface was created: the 1920’s and when jazz really started to take off. I even created a custom logo combining the image of the St. Jude’s child playing a saxophone. The foldout brochure features information about the jazz festival, a history of St. Jude’s hospital and their work in the medical field, followed by information on the dinner menu, local jazz artists who will be playing at the event and miscellaneous information like parking, hotels and vendors.  </p>
