            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>A recent graduate from Bowling Green State University (Ohio, not Kentucky), I just moved to the greater Boston area this past year. My life revolves around design and illustration (and my cat, Mina). I'm a big gothy nerd who loves vampires (I hate Twilight), ninjas, bats, owls and cats. I love sushi, cathedrals, horror films, Pokemon and video games. So enough about my likes...</p>
            <p>My obsession in life is to publish a novel and comic book someday. I always strive to do my best even to the point of driving myself insane. Attention to detail is where it's at: that's what I live by. I want to be a part of a small design firm because getting to know my fellow teammates is very important to me. Personal interaction is key. I don't want to just be another number in the system. I have a passion for learning and trying new things and I don't give up. So what have I been doing lately? In the time I've been out of school, I have spent time brushing up on HTML and CSS as well as improving my portfolio. I've started several personal projects, one being a fancomic (in Japanese, they're called "doujinshi") for my favorite anime of all time: Rurouni Kenshin.</p>
