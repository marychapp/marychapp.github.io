          <h3>Health and Wellness</h3>
          <h5>Logo Design Concepts and Web Banner</h5>
          <p>Featured throughout my portfolio are a number of pieces from my old place of employment: Unigraphics, a small design firm located in Bowling Green, Ohio where I attended college. The design firm caters to the needs of the small college town’s businesses and one of their biggest clients is the university itself as well as its numerous institutions. One such institution is the Intersections in Health and Wellness Research. This institution at the time was hosting a number of meet-ups and hosting conventions to spread awareness and report their casework in the medical field. In dire need of a new logomark, the institute sought out Unigraphics for their creative expertise. They wanted us to come up with a contemporary mark that blended each of the institute’s focused values which are the cornerstone of their work. There existed no consistent font or color scheme, so we had the luxury of helping the institute to define themselves. The project was shelved eventually due to complications, however, I was able to come up with several marks and a sample layout for one of their events using friendly, warm and trusting colors to unify the institute’s values into one cohesive and contemporary brand.</p>
