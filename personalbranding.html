          <h3>Personal Branding</h3>
          <p>Why did you choose a bat as part of your personal brand identity? To anyone who has to yet to know me personally, this may seem like an odd choice. You will find out quickly that by nature, I’m peculiar. I’ve never really fit into any particular group as my interests and values range in variation. I easily fall within the goth subculture although that is not my goal. I just am who I am. And like bats, who are often mislabeled and misunderstood, I find a kinship with them. Most people would not list a bat as their favorite animal, but I do. In fact, most find them repulsive and label them as pests. Some believe they are rodents (they are not). I once had someone claim that they were large insects (again, they are not). Bats are unusual and mysterious as they are nocturnal and rarely seen and when they are, we are often scared and disgusted of them. Myths and legends paint a picture of terror. Often they are associated with the goth culture, vampires and Satanic cults, believed to bring evil and destruction. However, bats are not evil. They are not bloodsuckers, (only three species do and they are not native to Romania, but to Middle and South America), they are extremely useful to the ecosystem, (they eat those annoying mosquitos, the real bloodsuckers) and they are quite interesting. Within some cultures, such as the Native American’s, they are believed to be insightful, spiritual  and possess keen observation as they rely on echolocation to navigate through the dark (no, they are not blind). This I attribute to my designer skills as I look at every detail and scrutinize it, aiming for the best results. Bats are family oriented, sticking to their designated colony and are extremely communicative, both of which I highly value in my personal life as well as my career. I seek to communicate articularetly and clearly in my work and to create deep ties with the connections I make within the design field. I’m not one for superficiality. I seek to understand and to be understood.  </p>
