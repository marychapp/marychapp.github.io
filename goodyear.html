          <h3>Goodyear</h3>
          <h5>Logo, Mobile App and UI design</h5>
          <p>I wanted to get some practice at designing user interfaces for websites, but I also wanted to attempt a redesign of an existing company’s logo. Goodyear was a good candidate. Before starting, I did a lot of research on the history of the company’s logo. Turns out, the logo remained nearly the same for about one hundred years since Goodyear first began its business. While many can identify with its longstanding logo and it reflects trust and reliability, I wanted to see if I could update it a bit while still maintaining those values. The color scheme was fine, although I did change the lemon yellow to a more goldenrod hue to reflect the level of value and trust the company has with its customers and product reliability. Many companies that are affiliated with the automotive industry use lines or wings to show progressive speed and moving forward. Even Goodyear’s original logo is slanted and has a winged foot for its mark. I kept that wing, but attached it to the “G” as a nod to their original winged foot.Their website on the other hand was awful and required extensive redesigning. It wasn’t easily navigational and it looked extremely outdated. I not only redesigned the website with a better more clear user interface for navigating, but I made a smartphone app user interface design as well for purchasing tires on-the-go if one finds themselves with a flat.</p>
