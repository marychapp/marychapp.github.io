          <h3>Ant Killer Cover Design</h3>
          <p>I have always taken a fascination in books, not just reading them, but the writing process as well. In fact, for several years, I considered becoming a writer. In the end, art won me over. However, writing wasn’t over for me. In fact, I feel it enchances my skill as a designer and who knows, I might still end up writing a novel sometime in the future. For now though, I know that my ability to write coherently and articulately is crucial in communication. But my love of reading and writing doesn’t stop there. In my senior year of college, I took a book binding class and if given the chance, I’d take it again and again; I enjoyed it that much. Being able to bind your very own book is a dream come true, a skill that as a child, dumbfounded me. It was something I thought was beyond my comprehension. Fortunately, it’s not hard to learn, just time consuming. Now I just needed to put it to use. A good friend of mine, Suzanna Anderson, a creative writing major, has seen her work published in several magazines. A collection of short stories was penned and headed under her most popular work, “The Ant Killer.” I saw it as a fantastic opportunity to bind my own hardcover book and create a unique cover design for her collection, something that would grab the reader right away. I wanted to use negative space and the viewer’s perspective at different distances in order to create more than one image. From far away, it looks as though a pool of blood is slowly absorbing the cover, like a classic murder mystery novel. Upon closer inspection though, it would reveal that the stain of blood is actually a colony of swarming red ants; something most would find unpleasant, but it’s so mesmerizing you cannot help but to keep watching and wonder what will happen next. </p>
